## Out of Scope (Tech Debt Tickets)

### High Priority Tech Debt
1. **Advanced Analytics** (2 hours)
   - Detailed response analytics and trends
   - Export functionality (CSV/PDF)

   - Custom date ranges

2. **Enhanced Security** (3 hours)
   - CAPTCHA integration for public surveys
   - Advanced bot detection
   - Audit logging for admin actions
   - Data encryption at rest

3. **User Experience Enhancements** (4 hours)
   - Survey templates and presets
   - Drag-and-drop question reordering
   - Rich text editor for questions
   - Survey preview functionality
   - Custom branding options

### Medium Priority Tech Debt
4. **Advanced Survey Features** (5 hours)
   - Multiple question types (text, dropdown, scale)
   - Conditional logic and branching
   - File upload support
   - Survey themes and customization

5. **Notification System** (2 hours)
   - Email notifications for survey completion
   - Slack/Teams integration
   - Real-time admin notifications
   - Survey milestone alerts

6. **Mobile Optimization** (3 hours)
   - Native mobile app (React Native)
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) features
   - Offline survey taking capability
   - Touch-optimized UI components

### Low Priority Tech Debt
7. **Advanced Deployment** (2 hours)
   - Multi-environment setup (staging, prod)
   - Blue-green deployment strategy
   - Automated rollback mechanisms
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

8. **Monitoring & Observability** (3 hours)
   - Comprehensive logging system
   - Performance monitoring dashboard
   - Error tracking and alerting
   - Business metrics tracking

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Risk: High load causing slow response times
   - Mitigation: Redis caching, database optimization, CDN usage

2. **Rate Limiting Failures**
   - Risk: Survey manipulation or spam
   - Mitigation: Multiple rate limiting layers, IP tracking, Redis fallbacks

3. **Real-time Connection Issues**
   - Risk: Dashboard not updating in real-time
   - Mitigation: Polling fallback, connection retry logic, error boundaries

### Operational Risks
1. **Deployment Failures**
   - Risk: Production deployment issues
   - Mitigation: Staging environment testing, automated rollback, health checks

2. **Third-party Service Outages**
   - Risk: Supabase/Redis/Google OAuth downtime
   - Mitigation: Graceful degradation, offline mode, service status monitoring

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- P95 page load time ≤ 2s
- P99 edge function latency ≤ 750ms
- Zero critical bugs in production
- 99.9% uptime during testing period

### Business Metrics
- Survey creation flow completion rate > 95%
- Survey response completion rate > 80%
- Admin dashboard load time < 1s
