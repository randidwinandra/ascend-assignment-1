## Out of Scope (Tech Debt Tickets)

### High Priority Tech Debt
1. **Enhanced Security & Rate Limiting** 
   - CAPTCHA integration for public surveys
   - Advanced bot detection algorithms
   - Multiple-layer rate limiting (IP, session, device fingerprinting)
   - Audit logging for admin actions
   - SQL injection prevention hardening

2. **Auto Expiry Scheduler** 
   - Background job system for survey expiration
   - Automated cleanup of expired survey data
   - Scheduled notifications before expiry
   - Graceful handling of timezone edge cases

3. **Comprehensive Testing Suite**
   - End-to-end testing with Playwright/Cypress
   - Load testing and performance benchmarking
   - Edge case testing for rate limiting
   - Browser compatibility testing automation
   - Integration testing for Redis failover

### Medium Priority Tech Debt
4. **Advanced Caching Strategy** 
   - Implement Redis caching for survey metadata
   - Cache invalidation strategies
   - Client-side caching for survey results
   - Database query result caching
   - CDN integration for static assets

5. **Pagination & Data Management** 
   - Implement pagination for survey lists
   - Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
   - Efficient database queries for large result sets
   - Data archiving strategy for old surveys

6. **Framework Architecture Review**

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Tasks | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | 45 min | Database & Auth | Schema design, RLS, Auth setup |
| 2 | 85 min | Backend APIs | Edge functions, Rate limiting, Analytics |
| 3 | 95 min | Admin Dashboard | Survey management, Results dashboard |
| 4 | 75 min | Public Interface | Survey forms, Real-time updates |
| 5 | 45 min | Testing & Polish | Integration tests, Performance optimization |
| 6 | 15 min | Deployment | Production deployment, Documentation |
| **Total** | **360 min** | **6 hours** | **Complete MVP** |

This 6h plan excludes CI/CD setup and DevOps automation effort, focusing instead on existing MVP features. The assumption is that we'll grow features incrementally, so fundamental tech debt takes priority.
